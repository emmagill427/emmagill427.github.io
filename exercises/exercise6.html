        <h2>About Me</h2>
    
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Emma Gill, and I am a junior English major and Information Technology minor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I currently specialize in the Study and Practice of Writing, and am completing the Professional Writing and Technical Communications certificate. I hope to combine my interests in writing and I.T. in my future career.            
            </p>

            <p>
                Here you will find various projects and exercises relating to Adobe software and HTML, as well as samples of my academic, creative, and professional writing.
