    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup salted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li> 2 and 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp all purpose flour (to make this gluten free, I recommend substituting with <a href="https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/gluten-free-all-purpose-baking-mix">King Arthur's Gluten-Free Baking Mix</a>)
            </li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>Chocolate chips (as many as your heart desires)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a pan over medium heat, stirring constantly until the butter is foamy. The butter should be a golden brown and have little brown specks floating in it. Immediately remove butter from heat. (About 8 minutes)</li>
            <li>Cover butter and let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then chill the butter in the fridge until it begins to solidify. (About 1 hour)</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat chilled butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until creamy.</li>
            <li>Add eggs and vanilla to butter and sugar mixture, beating until blended.</li>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, stir together flour and baking soda. (I recommend sifting the flour beforehand to avoid lumps)</li>
            <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients in small increments, beating on low speed until blended.</li>
            <li>Fold in chocolate chips until evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Place 2-inch balls of dough on a lined baking sheet. If dough is sticky, place the dough in the fridge for 5 to 10 minutes until solid again. (However, I recommend chilling your dough overnight for the perfect texture)
            <li> Bake until edges of cookies are golden. (about 11-13 minutes)</li>
            <li>Transfer cookies to cooling rack and cool. (about 15 minutes)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
